### **Round 2 Assignment: Wallet Risk Scoring From Scratch**

### **Instructions:**

### Given your experience working with the aave V2 protocol, it's assumed that you have a clear understanding of lending protocols and on-chain transaction analysis.

In this assignment, you are provided with a list of wallet addresses. Your task is as follows:

1. **Fetch Transaction History:**
    - Retrieve the transaction data for each provided wallet address from compound V2 or V3 protocol.
2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Organize and preprocess the transaction data to create meaningful features that can reflect each wallet's risk profile.
3. **Risk Scoring:**
    - Develop a scoring model that assigns each wallet a risk score ranging from **0 to 1000**.
    - Clearly document your feature selection, normalization method, and scoring logic.

### **Deliverables:**

- A CSV file with columns:

| **wallet_id** | **score** |
| --- | --- |
| 0xfaa0768bde629806739c3a4620656c5d26f44ef2 | 732 |
- A brief explanation detailing your:
    - Data Collection method
    - Feature selection rationale
    - Scoring method
    - Justification of the risk indicators used

Please ensure your approach is clear, justified, and scalable.
